# Towers Of Hanoi AI Project
> Class project to solve Towers Of Hanoi using two approaches: A* and Breadth First Search (BFS)

## Status
I am currently working on updating this program. While it is fully functional, I did this
project two years ago and have since adopted better practices. I will be changing some parts
for clarity and readability. The project style may also get some slight adjustments so it
looks better on github. This README will be finished once it is completed.
