# Towers Of Hanoi AI Project
> Class project to solve Towers Of Hanoi using two approaches: A* and Breadth First Search (BFS)

## Status
I am currently working on updating this program. While the code is fully functional, I did this
project two years ago and have since adopted better practices. I will be changing some parts
for clarity and readability purposes. The project style may also get a couple slight adjustments 
so it looks better on github. That includes this README, which will be finished once it is 
completed.
