# Towers Of Hanoi AI Project
> Class project to solve Towers Of Hanoi using two approaches: A* and Breadth First Search (BFS)

## Status
I am currently working on updating this program. While the code is fully functional, I did this
project two years ago and have since adopted better practices. I will be changing some parts
for clarity and readability. The project style may also get a couple slight adjustments so it
looks better on github. That includes this README, will be finished once it is completed.
