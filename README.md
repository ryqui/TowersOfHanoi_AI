# Towers Of Hanoi AI Project
> Class project to solve Towers Of Hanoi using two approaches: A* and Breadth First Search (BFS)

## Status
I am currently working on updating this program. While it is fully functional, I did this
project two years ago and there are a few changes I want to make. This README will be
updated once it is completed.
